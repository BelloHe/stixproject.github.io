## Get in Touch!

We're always happy to set up either teleconferences or in-person meetings (in
the Boston, MA and Washington, DC area) to go through an introductory session,
a more in-depth training/development session, or to walk you through how to map
your existing content into STIX. If that's something you're interested in,
reach out to us at [stix@mitre.org](mailto:stix@mitre.org) and let us know.

We also host occasional training sessions that are free and open to the public.
Information on these can be found on the
[training](http://stix.mitre.org/training/index.html) page.
