## OASIS Transition
[DHS](http://www.dhs.gov/office-cybersecurity-and-communications/) has transitioned STIX, [TAXII](https://taxiiproject.github.io/), and [CybOX](https://cyboxproject.github.io/) to [Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS)](https://www.oasis-open.org/), a non-profit consortium that drives the development, convergence, and adoption of open standards for the global information society, in May 2015.

## Discussion List & Archive

### OASIS Members

Members of OASIS who join the CTI TC and any of the subcommittees will be automatically added to the appropriate lists: the CTI TC list that you are added to when you join the TC, the public comment list mentioned below, and the subcommittee lists that you are added to when you join the STIX, TAXII, and CybOX subcommittees.

### Non-OASIS Members

Those who are not OASIS members or who don't want to join the TC can see the archived discussions on the OASIS website:

* [CTI TC Discussion List Archive](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/cti/)
* [CTI-STIX Subcommittee List Archive](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/cti-stix/)

#### CTI Users List
A new mailing list, cti-users@lists.oasis-open.org, has been created that is intended for discussing topics related to the effective use of STIX/TAXII/CybOX and the development of solutions that use these standards.  Unlike the other CTI TC lists, this list will be open to anyone to join and post to.
 
If you are interested in joining the cti-users list you will need to explicitly subscribe.  You may do that by sending a blank email message to [cti-users-subscribe@lists.oasis-open.org](mailto:cti-users-subscribe@lists.oasis-open.org) and then replying to the list server's email response requesting confirmation.

#### CTI TC Public Comment List
You can also provide comments to the TC via the CTI TC Public Comment List:

* [Subscribe](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/comments/form.php?wg_abbrev=cti) to submit a comment
* [Archives](https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/cti-comment/)

### Pre-Transition Archives

Prior to the transition to OASIS there was a STIX discussion list operated by MITRE. The archives for this list can be found [here](http://making-security-measurable.1364806.n2.nabble.com/STIX-Discussion-List-f7579090.html).
