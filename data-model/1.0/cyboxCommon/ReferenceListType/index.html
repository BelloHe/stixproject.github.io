          <p> Each Reference subelement should provide a single source from which more information and deeper insight can be obtained, such as a research paper or an excerpt from a publication. Multiple Reference subelements can exist. The sole component of this field is the id. The id is optional and translates to a preceding footnote below the context notes if the author of the entry wants to cite a reference. Not all subelements need to be completed, since some are designed for web references and others are designed for book references. The fields Reference_Author and Reference_Title should be filled out for all references if possible. Reference_Section and Reference_Date can be included for either book references or online references. Reference_Edition, Reference_Publication, Reference_Publisher, and Reference_PubDate are intended for book references, however they can be included where appropriate for other types of references. Reference_Link is intended for web references, however it can be included for book references as well if applicable. </p>
