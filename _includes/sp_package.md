As of STIX 1.2, the contextual fields in `STIX_Header` have been deprecated. If you want to give context to set of STIX content you should use a [Report](/data-model/{{site.current_version}}/report/ReportType). The `Information_Source` field is still available and should be used to indicate the source of content that's included in the report (in other words, it's equivalent to setting the `Information_Source` in each individual construct).
