If "inclusive" is specified, then a single conceptual relationship is being defined between the subject and the collection of objects indicated by the related items (i.e. the relationship is not necessarily relevant for any one particular object being referenced, but for the aggregated collection of objects referenced).

          <p>The Attributed_Threat_Actor field specifies a Threat Actor asserted to be attributed for a Campaign. The specification of multiple ThreatActor entries for a single Attribution entry would be interpreted as a logical AND composition of the set of specified ThreatActors with a shared Confidence and Information Source. This would be used to assert attribution to a combined set of ThreatActors.</p>
