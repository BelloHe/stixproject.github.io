## Background and usage

Indicators convey specific [Observable](/idioms/observable) patterns combined with contextual information intended to represent artifacts and/or behaviors of interest within a cyber security context. They consist of one or more Observable patterns potentially mapped to a related [TTP](idioms/ttp) context and adorned with other relevant metadata on things like confidence in the indicatorâ€™s assertion, handling restrictions, valid time windows, likely impact, sightings of the indicator, structured test mechanisms for detection, related campaigns, suggested courses of action, related indicators, the source of the Indicator, etc. Recognizing limitations in current standardized approaches of representation, STIX leverages community knowledge and best practices to define a new Indicator structure for representing Indicator information.
