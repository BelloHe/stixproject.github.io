## OASIS Transition
[DHS](http://www.dhs.gov/office-cybersecurity-and-communications/) transitioned STIX, [TAXII](https://github.com/TAXIIProject/), and [CybOX](https://github.com/CybOXProject/) to [Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS)](https://www.oasis-open.org/), a non-profit consortium that drives the development, convergence, and adoption of open standards for the global information society. The [Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Technical Committee (TC)](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cti) now leads the ongoing development of these standards. Organizations and individuals that wish to play a regular and active role in the shaping of these standards should consider joining OASIS and the CTI TC. Learn more about the transition:
