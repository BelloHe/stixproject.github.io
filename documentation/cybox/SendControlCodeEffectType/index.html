<h1>SendControlCodeEffectType<span class="subdued">CybOX Core Schema</span></h1>

<p>The SendControlCodeEffectType is intended to characterize the effects of actions upon objects where some control code, or other control-oriented communication signal, is sent to the object. For example, an action may send a control code to change the running state of a process.</p>
