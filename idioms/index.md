# STIX Idioms

STIX idioms can help you understand how to create idiomatic STIX content that other STIX users can understand.

Idioms are divided into cross-cutting features and specific use case idioms. The cross-cutting feature idioms, as you might expect, describe features that occur throughout STIX. These idioms will help you understand how STIX works but will not be grounded in specific use cases so might not make as much sense to a beginner.

Specific use case idioms, on the other hand, are grounded in an actual use case and describe one way of expressing that use case in STIX. As such, they might be better to get started.
